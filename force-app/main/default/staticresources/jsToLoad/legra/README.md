# LEGRA

Legra (**Le**go® brick **Gra**phics) is a small (*3.35KB gzipped*) JavaScript library that lets you draw using LEGO® like brick shapes on an HTML `<canvas>` element. This library defines basic graphics primitives like lines, rectangles, polygons, ellipses, bézier curves, etc. All shapes are drawn either outlined or filled in.
